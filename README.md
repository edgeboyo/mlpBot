# MLPBot

This bot was made to help me get completely trashed while watching My Little Pony.

It has a built in ruleset of when to drink but you're welcome to boot it up and try and come up with your own.

It also tracks previously watched episodes and how many drinks you've downed so much.

## Commands

* help - links you to this not so useful document
* watch 5 12 - Sets you on ✨watch mode✨ for this specific season and episode. Will check if it exists or has been watched of course. I'm competent enough to check for that *(TODO: Add a check for that)*
* roll - rolls a random episode on a random season. This will always be an unwatched episode. Sets you on ✨watch mode✨ for this episode.
* rollEp 5 - rolls a random episode on season 5 (or whichever you pick idk) season. This will always be an unwatched episode. Sets you on ✨watch mode✨ for this episode.
* drink - increments the drink counter (as long as you're in ✨watch mode✨)
* double - ^^^ but 2
* triple - ^^^ but 3
* finish - exits ✨watch mode✨ ands the currently drank drinks to the total drink counter and sums up your session for you.
* ruleset - shows you the ruleset (i know, creative)
* resetDrinks - resets the drink counter (will also reset the saved one). Won't reset your liver scarring tho
* resetWatches - fully resets all the watched episodes on your account. You can rewatch all of MLP again ạ̷̤̹͉̉̐̒n̸̤̻͑d̵̼̻͐̈̏ ̸̞̖͗̑w̴̲̋̾͝h̴̫̳̩̔͑a̵̱̬͚̹͛̋̈́t̵̛̟͒͋ ̴͔̦͔̬̀ẃ̶̨͔̹̝ö̵̥̣͕̭́̿n̶̰͇͛̃̓͐d̸͖̺̞̗͝ë̵̡̦̙̈́̊̆r̵̯̞̣̜̍̌͆̍ ̸͓̺͛͝t̵̘̩̮͗h̵̞͙̙̔̑̉̏a̷͐́̉͒ͅt̵̟͉̙͎̑̚ ̵̢̮̼̘͐i̷̝͎͌s̸͎̕͝.

* stop - debug. Turns of the bot. I swear I will remove this before production.
